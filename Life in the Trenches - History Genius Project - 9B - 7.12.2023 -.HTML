Design of the Trenches

<p><font size="5" font face="Calibri"><div class="info-box">

    Allied trenches were long, narrow ditches that were around 2 metres deep and had wooden supports on either side. At the beginning of the war, they were constructed hurriedly in response to enemy advancements, leading to poor design. However, as the war progressed, their construction was improved. The trenches’ walls were lined with sandbags, filled with soil and mud for protection against enemy fire. They were arranged in a zig zag pattern to provide protection against explosives and cover against raiding infantry. The Germans dug more reinforced trenches, using a greater amount of steel and concrete. These were 15 metres deep with drainage systems, strategic machine gun emplacements, electric generators, cookers and anti-gas curtains.<br><br>

   <br><br>The front lines was where soldiers could fire from.<br><br>
   The support trenches offered a backup line of defence if the front line was captured. <br><br>
    The reserve trench was where men were sent forward when needed. <br><br>
    Dugouts offered a shelter where servicemen could rest<br><br>
 No man’s land separated enemy trenches. Muddy conditions, barbed wire and craters from artillery made this area difficult to navigate.<br><br>
 The soldiers moved across and sent messages through the trenches via the communication trenches, that connected the three. Communication methods included the use of signal flags, telephone lines and carrier pigeons. However, things such as the risk of being seen by the opposition, weather conditions and enemy fire made this process difficult.

There was a shortage of fruits and vegetables, so men usually ate bread, Maconochie’s meat stew, biscuits and pea soup. Soldiers received food like chocolates, biscuits, sardines and tobacco from friends and family back home. In 1917: the ration of the average British soldier was 6 ounces of corned beef.<br><br>
            
            Servicemen got drinking water from water depots behind the front lines or by collecting rainwater from artillery creators. However, the latter would expose soldiers to harmful bacteria so water purification tablets were sometimes used to clean the water. Additionally, soldiers also drank tea, coffee and alcohol (such as rum, beer, wine and spirits).<br><br>

   <br><br> Soldiers wore the khaki serge: a green-brown camouflaged combat uniform adopted in 1902, which was made of wool serge. Soldiers also wore steel headgear (called the Brodie helmet) and ankle-high leather boots.<br><br>
The webbing kit was a series of pouches connected by straps. The kit’s contents varied depending on the rank of the soldier but could consist of ammunition pouches, entrenching tool carrier (holding a foldable shovel), grenade pouch, gas mask bag, water bottle carrier and haversack. The haversack held the soldier’s personal items, such as their knife, a mess kit (carrying cups, plates and utensils), shaving kit, food rations and extra clothing.

    Soldier's uniforms were often infected with lice due to the poor hygiene.  These lice spread easily among the overcrowded trenches and caused trench fever. Trench fever was a rarely fatal illness that caused high temperature, headaches, tenderness and joint pain. <br><br>
 
    Trench foot: Trenches flooded during heavy rain, especially during winter creating mud. This, along with the overflown latrines, meant men had to dry their feet and change their socks at least twice a day. Otherwise, the blisters and cuts on the feet would become infected: leading to numbness, swelling and gangrene. Trench foot could result in the amputation of the toes or feet of some men. <br><br>
     
      
     
    Rats, who were attracted to the trenches’ food rations and corpses, also spread diseases. Some soldiers reported that rats grew to the size of cats. <br><br>

    Shell shock (now known as PTSD or post-traumatic stress disorder) was a neurosis caused by the stress soldiers experienced. At the time, it was thought that the condition was caused by the constant exposure to artillery fire. Symptoms of shell shock included uncontrollable movements, trouble sleeping, confusion, memory loss and sometimes partial paralysis.  Soldiers suffering from shell shock refused to go into no-man’s land and thus were shot by their trench mates on the accusation of being a coward. <br><br>
 
    Boredom and paranoia were also common among soldiers. <br><br>

    <b>Being on watch:</b> Men who were on watch tracked enemy activity from outposts. If one was caught sleeping during this duty: they could be sentenced to imprisonment or death.  <br><br>
 
  
 
   <b> Daily duties: </b>Some other duties included restacking and refilling sandbags, fixing barbed wire, cleaning weapons, digging or reinforcing areas of the trench, patrols, distributing supplies and getting trench stores. Stand to arms was another job, where soldiers would guard the front line – prepared for an attack. <br><br>
     
      
     
   <b> Other jobs:</b> Other jobs soldiers included digging and emptying latrines (trench toilets), conducting reconnaissance missions, disposing waste and manning communications to send messages between the trench lines. <br><br>
     
      
     
   <b> Rest:</b> Soldiers had free time in the afternoon. They also had downtime at night but only for an hour at a time in between work. In their leisure, they cleaned their weapons and uniforms, played cards, slept and wrote letters. These letters, however, had to be checked by an officer so that no classified information would be exposed and morale wouldn’t be ruined. <br>

What Weapons were used?
</font face="Century Gothic"> </font size="10"></p><font color="black">

<div class="info-box"><p><font size="5" font face="Calibri">

    Machine guns: Machine guns were placed on the front lines and could fire hundreds of rounds per minute with long-range abilities. <br><br>
 
    Barbed wires were placed a distance away from the front lines and trapped enemies. Artillery or gun fire would sometimes be used to guide enemies into barbed wire. <br><br>
     
    Artillery were explosive shells that released shrapnel. They targeted, trenches, artillery batteries and could be used to disrupt enemy raids. <br><br> 
    Landmines: Landmines were used to protect the trenches, deterring enemy raids. They were also placed in no man's land to impede infantry assault. Additionally, they were also placed in tunnels to collapse opposing trenches or underground to obstruct enemy tunnelling activities. Additionally, anti-tank mines were also used to destroy armoured vehicles and some soldiers made make-shift mines from other explosives. <br><br>
     
    Personal weapons: in the beginning of the war, most servicemen only had a rifle fitted with a bayonet. British soldiers used the SMLE (Short Magazine Lee–Enfield Mk III Rifle) and German soldiers used the Gewehr 98. However, as the war progressed, the soldiers' arsenal came to include equipment such as grenades and rifle grenades. The guns soldiers had depended on their role and country, but often include firearms such as handguns, submachine guns (that saw some use towards the end of the war) and shotguns. <br><br>
